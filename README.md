Create a task board application where users can manage tasks using drag-and-drop functionality. The board should have columns representing different stages of a task (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done). Allow users to move tasks between columns and persist the changes.

Note :- Make a new project and complete the flow using React and Typescript .
